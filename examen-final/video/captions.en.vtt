WEBVTT - Some title

00:01.000 --> 00:07.000
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Only this and nothing more.”
